<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up fs120">The</span> first requisite in the preparation of good
sandwiches is to have perfect bread in suitable
condition. Either white, brown, rye, or
entire wheat bread may be used, but it should
be of close, even texture and at least one day old.</p>

<p>Cream the butter with a wooden spoon and spread
smoothly on the bread before it is cut; after cutting
remove the crust and avoid spreading the butter or filling
over the edge. When ready to serve, cut the sandwiches
either square, triangular, long, narrow, round,
or crescent shaped.</p>

<p>In making rolled bread sandwiches, cut off the
crust of a loaf of fresh bread and spread a thin layer
of butter on one end of the loaf; cut off this buttered
end in as thin a slice as possible and spread with the
sandwich filling; roll up this slice and lay on a napkin;
draw the napkin firmly around the rolled bread and
pin it. Put in a cool place until ready to serve, then
remove napkin and tie the sandwiches with baby ribbon
or fasten with a tooth pick.</p>

<p>French rolls may be used for picnics and out-of-door
luncheons. Remove from the top of each roll
a piece of the crust the size of a silver dollar, and with
a spoon take out the centre. Fill the space with highly
seasoned chopped meat, fish, lobster, or crab, replace
lid, wrap in tissue paper, and serve with pickles or olives.</p>

<p>For very small, dainty sandwiches to be served at
afternoon teas or luncheons, the bread may be baked
at home in pound baking powder cans. These should
be only half filled, and then allowed to rise before
baking. You then have a round slice without crust.</p>

<p>A garnish such as the following may be used:
For meat sandwiches, use pickles, olives, lettuce, watercress,
parsley, and mint. For fish sandwiches, use
pickles, olives, cress, parsley, slices of lemon, and hard-boiled
egg. For cheese sandwiches, use pickles and
olives. For sweet sandwiches, use lettuce, maiden hair
fern, smilax, berries, flowers, and candied fruit.</p>

<p>To keep sandwiches fresh, if prepared an hour
or two before serving, wring out a napkin in cold water
and cover the tray and keep in a cool place or wrap
in wax paper.</p>
